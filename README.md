Here are those points enhanced to sound human, professional, and ready for your GitHub README:

🚀 Milestone 1: Data Foundations & Engineering
In this first phase, I shifted my focus from just writing code to understanding the "DNA" of an application: the data itself.

Knowledge Graphs: Explored how to move beyond basic tables to represent data as a network of real-world relationships and entities.

Dataset Mastery: Learned to identify different data structures and what actually makes a dataset "high quality" for a Spring Boot application.

The Hunt for Data: Scouted various online repositories (Kaggle, UCI, etc.) and categorized different data types to find the best fit for my projects.

The "Janitor" Work (Cleaning & Insertion): Got my hands dirty with Python libraries to scrub messy datasets and automate the insertion process—because a great app is only as good as the data feeding it.
